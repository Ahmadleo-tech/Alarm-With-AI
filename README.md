# AI-Enhanced Alarm System

This Python-based alarm clock project integrates AI to provide a more interactive and intelligent user experience. The alarm allows users to set a specific time, and when it goes off, it uses text-to-speech technology to announce the wake-up call.

### Features:
- **Time-based Alarm**: Users can input the alarm time in the format `HH:MM:SS AM/PM`.
- **Text-to-Speech Integration**: The alarm speaks a custom wake-up message when triggered, adding a personal touch to your morning routine.
- **Plays Sound**: When the alarm time is reached, it plays an MP3 file.
- **Voice Confirmation**: Confirms the alarm setup by speaking out the time that was set.
- **Expandable**: Ready for future AI integrations like weather updates, reminders, or personalized notifications.

### How It Works:
1. The user inputs the desired alarm time.
2. The system continuously checks the current time and compares it with the set time.
3. When the time matches, the alarm goes off, playing a sound file and announcing the wake-up message using AI-powered text-to-speech.
4. The project can be expanded to include additional features like smart scheduling or weather-based alerts.

### Requirements:
- **Python 3.x**
- Libraries:
  - `playsound` for playing alarm sounds.
  - `pyttsx3` for text-to-speech functionality.
  
Install dependencies with:
```bash
pip install playsound pyttsx3
```

### Usage:
1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
2. Run the script and set the desired alarm time in the `HH:MM:SS AM/PM` format.
3. The AI will confirm the alarm setup and notify you when the time arrives.
